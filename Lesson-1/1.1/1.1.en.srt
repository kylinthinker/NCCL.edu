00:00:00,281 --> 00:00:09,042
[主讲老师 - @亚嵌李明老师, AKAEDU] 好，我们在当前目录下先新建一个文件夹,

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:17,538
取名叫 myNCCL，代表的是我们自己要写的所有的C程序。

3
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:19,862
接下来我们要打开一个Lesson-1.c 

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're going to learn some of the core ideas in computer science.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're going to learn to program in a language called Python,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and you're going to build a search engine that by the end of 7 weeks

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
will have all the main components of a search engine like Google in it.

13
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,804
Learning about computing is really one of the most powerful things you can do.

14
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:40,380
Computers are these amazing machines that can be programmed to do anything.

15
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,770
And once you learn a little bit about programming, you can sort of start to envision

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,510
the power that you have, the things that you can build with computers.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,085
One of the great things about computing is that you don't really need a lot of resources

18
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:51,664
to build something that can change the world.

19
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,777
If you learn a little bit, if you have a creative idea,

20
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:57,353
you can build something, you can deploy your application to millions of people

21
00:00:57,353 --> 00:01:00,372
on the Internet, and it doesn't really take a lot of resources to do that.

22
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,042
It just takes a little creativity and a little bit of knowledge.

23
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:05,643
So David, this is really exciting. I'm looking forward to seeing your class.

24
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:09,335
I'll be making occasional appearances, but I have my own class to teach.

25
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,632
But David will teach this wonderful class, and I think we should just dive in.

26
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:15,000
Great! Well, let's get started.
